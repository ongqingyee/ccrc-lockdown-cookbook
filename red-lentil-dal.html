            <p>This was the first dal recipe I ever cooked and it kick-started an obsession. It's not my recipe but it's super simple, super tasty, and a great weeknight meal. It's also vegetarian and vegan friendly! </p>

        <h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
              <ul>
              <li> 4 tbs olive oil </li> 
              <li> 2 cups red lentils </li>
              <li> 2 onions (halved and thinly sliced) </li>
              <li> 2 small red chilies (thinly sliced) </li>
              <li> 3 garlic cloves (crushed) </li>
              <li> 2 tbs ginger (chopped/grated) </li>
              <li> 1 tsp cumin seeds (whole, not ground) </li>
              <li> 1 tsp fennel seeds (whole, not ground) </li>
              <li> 1 tsp turmeric (ground) </li>
              <li> 1 can coconut milk </li>
              <li> 1 L vegetable stock </li>
              <li> 1 bunch of coriander </li>
              <li> 1 lemon </li>
              <li> 1 packet of soft tortillas (optional) </li>

chili flakes (optional) 

rice (any type is fine) 
              </ul>

          <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
          
          Heat 3 tbs of the oil in a large saucepan or cast-iron pot. Add the cumin, fennel, and turmeric and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the thinly sliced onions and cook for 5 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic and chilies and continue cooking until the onions are translucent. Meanwhile, finely chop the coriander stems until you have 2 tbs worth. Once the onions are cooked, add the chopped coriander stems, red lentils, coconut milk and stock to the saucepan (it will look like a lot of liquid, but it gets absorbed quickly!). Bring to a simmer and cook over low to moderate heat for about 20-25 minutes until the lentils are tender. While the dal is simmering, cook some rice. To make the chili flatbread (optional), fry the soft tortillas in a shallow fry pan with the remaining 1 tbs of oil and a generous shake of chili flakes. Cook both sides until golden brown. Serve the dal over rice with a side of chili flatbread. It's extra delicious with a squeeze of lemon juice on top and some added coriander leaves.

           <p>  The original recipe also calls for kale, but I've never bothered with it. Up to you if you wish to add :) </p>
